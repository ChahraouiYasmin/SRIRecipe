    "Place chicken in large pot with onions, parsley, cilantro, spices (1 tbsp cinnamon, ginger, turmeric, saffron, salt, pepper), and cover with water. Bring to boil, then simmer for 1.5 hours until chicken is very tender.",
    "Remove chicken, let cool, then shred meat, discarding skin and bones. Strain and reserve cooking liquid.",
    "Toast almonds in dry pan until golden, then coarsely chop. Mix with 50g sugar and 1 tbsp orange blossom water.",
    "In a clean pan, reduce 2 cups of reserved cooking liquid by half. Beat eggs and slowly pour into reduced liquid, stirring constantly to make a thick custard. Cook until set but still moist.",
    "Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F). Brush a round baking dish with melted butter.",
    "Layer 10 sheets of warqa/phyllo in the dish, brushing each sheet generously with melted butter and rotating sheets to cover entire dish with overhang.",
    "Spread shredded chicken evenly over pastry. Top with egg custard, then almond mixture.",
    "Fold overhanging pastry over filling. Cover with remaining 10 pastry sheets, brushing each with butter.",
    "Tuck edges neatly and brush top with remaining butter. Bake for 30-40 minutes until golden and crisp.",
    "Remove from oven and immediately invert onto serving platter so the bottom becomes the top.",
    "Dust generously with powdered sugar and decorate with cinnamon lines in a lattice pattern.",
    "Serve warm, cutting into wedges to show the beautiful layers."
