        "Heat the dashi broth in a pot over medium heat until it becomes hot but not boiling. Avoid boiling to preserve the delicate flavors.",
        "Soak the dried wakame seaweed in a small bowl of water for 5 minutes, then drain and set aside.",
        "Cut the tofu into small, even cubes of about 1 cm for a traditional texture.",
        "Place the wakame and tofu into the hot dashi broth and simmer gently for 2\u20133 minutes.",
        "In a small separate bowl, add the miso paste. Ladle a small amount of the hot broth into the bowl and whisk until the miso dissolves completely.",
        "Turn off the heat under the soup pot. Stir in the dissolved miso mixture gently to avoid lumps.",
        "Add the chopped green onions right before serving for a fresh flavor.",
        "Serve immediately while warm, as miso soup should not be reheated to boiling."
