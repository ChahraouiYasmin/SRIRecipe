  "instructions": [
    "Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F). Grease 9x13 inch baking pan or traditional mazurek pan.",
    "For dough: In food processor, pulse flour, powdered sugar, and salt. Add cold butter and pulse until crumbly.",
    "Add egg yolks, sour cream, and vanilla. Pulse until dough comes together. Don't overmix.",
    "Press dough evenly into prepared pan. Prick all over with fork. Bake for 20-25 minutes until light golden. Cool completely.",
    "For almond topping: Beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually add sugar and beat until stiff peaks. Fold in ground almonds and lemon juice. Spread over cooled crust.",
    "For fruit topping: Warm apricot jam with 2 tbsp water. Spread thin layer over crust. Arrange dried fruits and candied peel in decorative patterns. Brush with remaining jam.",
    "For chocolate topping: Heat cream until steaming. Pour over chopped chocolate, let sit 5 minutes, then stir until smooth. Add butter and stir until glossy. Spread over crust.",
    "Bake almond-topped mazurek for 15-20 minutes until golden. Fruit and chocolate versions don't need baking.",
    "Cool completely in pan. Create intricate designs using different toppings in sections or make one unified design.",
    "Use nuts, candied fruits, or piped chocolate to create Easter motifs: lambs, crosses, flowers, or geometric patterns.",
    "Let set completely (refrigerate chocolate version). Cut into small squares or diamonds while still in pan.",
    "Dust with powdered sugar before serving. Mazurek should be very sweet and rich - serve small portions."
